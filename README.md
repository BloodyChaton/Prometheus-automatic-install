# Prometheus-automatic-install
My goal here will be to install Prometheus and Grafana on two different machines by executing bash scripts. Node Explorer will also be installed on both machines in order to set examples and see if the machine communicate correctly. The setting up of Grafana's dashboards is manual though.
